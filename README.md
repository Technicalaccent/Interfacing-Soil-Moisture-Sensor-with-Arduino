Interfacing Soil Moisture Sensor with Arduino

<br>

Where should soil moisture sensors be placed?

Sensors should be placed at several different depths and locations in the field. Typically, sensors are placed in pairs at one-third and two-thirds the depth of the crop root zone and at two or more locations in the field, preferably away from high points, depressions and slopes.

How much area can a soil moisture sensor cover?

It depends on the sensor. A satellite-based passive microwave sensor will cover a very wide area of ground, while cheap Chinese hobby sensors can cover only 20-30 cm of land.

Why should soil moisture be continuously monitored?

Soil moisture monitoring can help growers efficiently use and apply water and nutrients. All soil moisture instruments provide data that help a grower make good decisions about how much water to apply and when to apply it.
